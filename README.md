# Clone Uber Interface

> This is a demonstration of some screens and features of the Uber app. I used React Native as a development framework.

## Motivation

This implementation was initially created by the excellent developer called **Diego Fernandes**, from the company **Rocketseat**.

My goal in replicating this implementation again was to reinforce my learning in React Native, in addition to getting to know the Google APIs better.
